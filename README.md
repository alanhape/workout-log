workout-log
===========

simple workout data log

This application is designed to have the user enter in basic workout information (example: reps, sets, weight) 
into a mysql database from the HTML page, using JavaScript. With that, it is also going to eventually have 
capabilities to retrieve that data into an HTML table format. There will be other features added in time, 
but for now, that is the mission.
